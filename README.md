# streak-Pd-Ni
Octave script to extract radial data from Streak images based on the light level on the image.

To use it, just put in the same folder the ".m" files and the Streak images with the extension ".dat", and run the main file "streak-Pd-Ni.m" in an Octave console. It will produce as output a ".txt" file with the radial expansion, and a ".jpg" file with the original streak an dthe found points overimposed, to check that everything is Ok.
